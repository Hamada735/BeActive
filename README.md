# BeActive (CS317 - Mobile App Development - Group Assingment - Group 27)

### Installation

After cloning the repository run the following commands in the terminal. This was tested with NodeJS version 16.18.0, but should work on any newer version

* ```
  npm install
  ```
* ```
  npx expo start
  ```

  * *expo* is a tool we are going to use for development, since it is officially recommended as the fastest way to test applications on our own mobile devices
  * npx is the package runner of NodeJS packages, in this case this means you do not have to install expo on your machine, it executes the package freshly downloaded from the web. (As far as I understand it correctly)
  * Running this command starts a server on your machine and should output a URL and a QR code in the terminal.
* Install Expo on your phone.
* Scan the QR code/Enter the URL from your machine terminal and after some processing, you should be able to see the app on your phone!
