BeActive is React Native mobile app 'prototype' made to study cross-platform mobile development as part of our curriculum.

We aimed to have a positive impact on our user's wellbeing by designing an app which would help them be physically active as well as connect with others. We wanted users to engage positively with the physical activity, so we quickly settled on short bursts of activity the user can engage with whenever they choose, but we will also send them a notification that an exercise has been selected for them for the day to keep them engaged! Through various methods we check how the user performed during the exercise, then to keep everyone connected and motivated we want users to share their performance with their friends on the social feed. By having our users engaged with physical activity, engaging with others as well as giving and receiving positive feedback we hope to support people's wellbeing.

We chose to create an Expo-powered React Native application. Our frontend started with an Ignite boilerplate. We used the Expo API for access to the device sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope) and Native Notify to deliver push notifications. We are also using the TensorFlow.js library to enable camera-recorded exercise recognition for various exercises.

## Running the project

###Install:
  â€˜npm install â€“legacy-peer-depsâ€™ in the terminal
###Run:
  â€˜npm run expo:startâ€™  in the terminal
 Notifications might not work as you need an Expo account to run them.
